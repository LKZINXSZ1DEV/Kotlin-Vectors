# About Kotlin Vectors.
* This project is just a base for vectors, where you can perform operations with vectors, such as addition, multiplication and division. With this, you can perform orientations with objects in games, or store more than one number at once, which can make the issue of code organization even easier..

# Examples to start.
```kotlin
val jVector2 = KVector2(); // This is equals a JVector2(x: 0, y: 0);
val jVector3 = KVector3(120); // This is equals a JVector3(x: 120, y: 120, z: 120);
val jVector4 = KVector4(100, 200, 300, 400); // This is equals a JVector4(x: 100, y: 200, z: 300, w: 400);

val sumResult = KVectorManager.Sum(jVector2, jVector3); // This is equals a JVector2(x: x1 + x2, y: y1 + y2);
val multiplyResult = KVectorManager.Multiply(jVector2, jVector3); // This is equals a JVector2(x: x1 * x2, y: y1 * y2);
val divideResult = KVectorManager.Divide(jVector2, jVector3); // This is equals a JVector2(x: x1 / x2, y: y1 / y2);
```
*As you can see above, it is very easy to use.*
